                <h3>Film Review - The Women</h3>
                <p>Opening scene: A tiny yorkie goes 
                    berserk at another dog while 
                    on a walk (common experience 
                    for small dog owners). After 
                    flashing its sharp teeth, it is 
                    scooped up by an obviously wealthy 
                    socialite, who coddles and calls 
                    the yorkie “precious” and sneers 
                    and calls the other (simply passing) 
                    dog “nasty.” </p>

                <p>And thus the premise is set. </p>
                
                <p>“The Women” could easily be called 
                    “The 1930s’ Real Housewives of 
                    New York”. (But with good writing!)
                    <!-- It follows a gatekeeping, homogenous 
                    friend group who break up a marriage 
                    and then put it back together.
                    These women aren’t role models, they’re 
                    just rich people, getting into the 
                    most entertaining conflicts that 
                    pre-WWII New York high society could offer. -->
                    I found the ensemble fascinating.
                    The script works hard to ensure 
                    you are never bored and that the 
                    absence of men feels natural.</p>
                
                <p>Final scene: Crystal’s parting words, 
                    “There’s a name for you ladies, 
                    but it isn't used in high society… 
                    outside a kennel!” Well, Mary is indeed 
                    that bitch. After her vicious snap at 
                    nasty Crystal succeeds in driving her 
                    off, Mary is swept back into the embrace 
                    of her husband and the high society 
                    status he symbolizes— where she is 
                    always loved, and always excused.</p>

                <h3>Film Review - Gone Girl</h3>
                <p>I’ve been craving more of Gillian Flynn’s work, 
                    and it was either read the book again or finally 
                    watch this film. </p>
                <p>Unlike Dark Places and Sharp 
                    Objects, Gone Girl lets its plot twists 
                    appear in the center of the plot rather 
                    than at the very end. Every event plays 
                    like a chess match move between Nick and Amy. 
                    (I say the book is better, because 
                    Amy and Nick’s initial 
                    motivations were not communicated at all in 
                    the film. Plus, knowing their exact thoughts 
                    enrich the ending.)</p>
                <p>
                    Nevertheless the film adapts everything else 
                    that is important to the story while 
                    also being masterfully produced and 
                    entertaining.</p>
                <p>Major props for Tyler Perry’s delivery 
                    of the line “You two are the most 
                    fucked up people I ever met, and I 
                    specialize in fucked up people”

                <h3>Film Review - The Power of the Dog</h3>
                <p>One of my favorite films of 2021.</p>
                <p>
                    Like the book, this is a story told through hands. 
                    The comb. The crafts. A gentle hand placed 
                    on her shoulder as she's crying. No gloves. 
                    New gloves. All are moments lifted from the 
                    text and with the addition of a brilliant 
                    new scene: Peter flipping though his 
                    medical textbook, briefly pausing on 
                    the page that illustrates the vulnerable 
                    areas of the palms...</p>
                <p>
                    Benny C's uncanny cowboy 
                    drawl could have ruined this 
                    film! But the direction, the 
                    cinematography, elevates the 
                    story to something bigger than 
                    the characters. It's deliberate and perfect.

                    yellow in his flower petals have darkened significantly,
                    due to the reaction of chrome yellow with other pigments in sunlight.

                    Some of them had casual arrangements with the families of farm 
                    workers, but much of the time they had to forage for themselves.

                    breathing and snuffling along in the dark.
                    When I was working in the cabin, they waited on the font

                <h3>Film Review - Portrait of a Lady on Fire</h3>
                <p>This was the last film I saw in 
                    theaters before COVID hit.</p>

                <p>I like stories with 3-6 main 
                    characters and minimum 2 plotlines. 
                    This film had nothing for me</p>
