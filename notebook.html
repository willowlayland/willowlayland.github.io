                <h3>Film Review - Gone Girl</h3>
                <p>I’ve been craving more of Gillian Flynn’s work, 
                    and it was either read the book again or finally 
                    watch this film. </p>
                <p>This story is probably the best of Flynn’s 
                    writing. Because, unlike Dark Places and Sharp 
                    Objects, Gone Girl lets its plot twists 
                    appear in the center of the plot rather 
                    than at the very end. Every event plays 
                    like a chess match move between Nick and Amy. 
                    (I say the book is better, because 
                    Amy and Nick’s initial 
                    motivations were not communicated at all in 
                    the film. Plus, knowing their exact thoughts 
                    enrich the ending.)</p>
                <p>
                    Nevertheless the film adapts everything else 
                    that is important to the story while 
                    also being masterfully produced and 
                    entertaining.</p>
                <p>Major props for Tyler Perry’s delivery 
                    of the line “You two are the most 
                    fucked up people I ever met, and I 
                    specialize in fucked up people”

                <h3>Film Review - The Power of the Dog</h3>
                <p>One of my favorite films of 2021.</p>
                <p>
                    Like the book, this is a story told through hands. 
                    The comb. The crafts. A gentle hand placed 
                    on her shoulder as she's crying. No gloves. 
                    New gloves. All are moments lifted from the 
                    text and with the addition of a brilliant 
                    new scene: Peter flipping though his 
                    medical textbook, briefly pausing on 
                    the page that illustrates the vulnerable 
                    areas of the palms...</p>
                <p>
                    Benny C's uncanny cowboy 
                    drawl could have ruined this 
                    film! But the direction, the 
                    cinematography, elevates the 
                    story to something bigger than 
                    the characters. It's deliberate and perfect.

                    Research carried out on Van Gogh's paintings in Amsterdam
                    over the past few years has shown that some of the chrome 
                    yellow in his flower petals have darkened significantly,
                    due to the reaction of chrome yellow with other pigments in sunlight.
